# Grocery Object Detection with YOLOv7

This project focuses on detecting grocery items using a custom dataset and YOLOv7. Various data augmentation techniques were applied to improve performance.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
- **Dataset:** Collected and annotated grocery images using Roboflow.
- **Augmentations:** Applied rotation, scaling, contrast adjustment, and noise addition.
- **Model:** Trained different versions of YOLOv7 on Google Colab.
- **Evaluation:** Compared models based on mAP, precision, and recall.
